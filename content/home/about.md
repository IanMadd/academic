My name is Ian Maddaus. I am a technical writer and a member of the Society for Technical Communication with an interest in R programming, data analysis, and GIS. I have a Master of Fine Arts in [Science and Natural History Filmmaking](http://sfp.montana.edu/sciencenaturefilm/) from Montana State University, but since I graduated I've found that I like technical writing, GIS, and R more than filmmaking. Now I spend my time writing documents about complicated things.
