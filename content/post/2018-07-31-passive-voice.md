Here are a few articles about using the passive voice. I could provide my own commentary but these articles are better than anything that I would write. In short, people often use the passive voice excessively or incorrectly, but the passive voice is an effective way to describe a passive subject or a victim.

# How To Identify The Passive Voice


I was stumped when I first started looking for the passive voice in my own writing. It's easy to recognize when you see it, but it can be hard to find when you don't, even if it's staring you right in the face. These are a few short guidelines for identifying the passive voice. 

## Zombies

* If you can add the phrase "by zombies" after the verb, you have passive voice.

Consider the sentence: The child threw the ball. Adding “by zombies” doesn’t make sense: The child threw by zombies. But, adding “by zombies” to the passive voice version of this sentence --- "The ball was thrown by the child" --- does make sense: The ball was thrown by zombies.

 
## Subject Verb Object

* The order of an active voice sentence is subject, verb, object.

The subject of a sentence is usually performing an action on another object. For example: the zombies are eating my brain. The zombies, the subject, are eating, the verb, my brain, the object. If you reverse it you get a passive voice sentence. My brain is being eaten by zombies. See above where I mention the phrase "by zombies".


## "by ..."

* A passive voice sentence often ends with "by ..."

For example: "My brain was eaten by zombies."

## To be, followed by "...ed"
