      <title>BFG Repo-Cleaner - Deleting Large File From Git</title>

      <description>BFG Repo-Cleaner is the best way to delete a large file from a git repository that you&amp;rsquo;ve already committed.
When a file is committed to a repository, it stays in the repository&amp;rsquo;s history, and is uploaded to a remote repository, even if you remove it in a subsequent commit. This allows a user to undo a subsequent commit and return to a previous version without losing any files. However, users may want to completely delete a file that is too large for the remote server or could have sensitive information stored in it.</description>

      <description>Here are a few articles about using the passive voice. I could provide my own commentary but these articles are better than anything that I would write. In short, people often use the passive voice excessively or incorrectly, but the passive voice is an effective way to describe a passive subject or a victim.
 Poynter Institute - NPR tornado report reveals the elements of vivid newswriting Poynter Institute - In praise of the passive voice Poynter Institute - Blindsided: How Christie used passive verbs to turn himself into a victim NY Times - The Pleasures and Perils of the Passive  How To Identify The Passive Voice I was stumped when I first started looking for the passive voice in my own writing.</description>

1. Markdown or R Markdown This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.</description>
